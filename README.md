### <a name="description"></a> Description

This repo is an effort for future developers to easily get a database of exercises in JSON format for any kind of development that may need it.

Developing apps is hard enough, you shouldn't waste time creating your own database of workouts. Focus on your app, let this repo handle the database of exercises.

### <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Clone the repo:
```
Main.main()

...run it

View the JSON object in the console

Will likely fail as current file is hard coded to my local path
(Currently working on a better way to get the JSON)
```
View the [roadmap](#roadmap) to see our plan to get to a better user experience

### <a name="roadmap"></a> Roadmap

These are the goals we hope to hit mostly in order. 
Create an issue if you want to add to this.

**Milestones**
 - ~~Create the basic JSON object format~~
 - ~~Create the database with exercises~~
 - ~~Generate a JSON from the SQL database~~
 - ~~Dynamically grab the columns and generate the JSON that way instead of hard coding~~
 - Create a UI for users to select how they want their JSON to be created
 - ~~Allow the JSON to be saved to the computer~~
 - Create an executable app *.exe* 
 - Add a solid amount of exercises, most workout apps have around 100 so we hope to exceed that
 - Host the database
 - Host a website for quick downloads of the full and some custom JSONs
 - Use the website to host the JSON
 - Create an API to access the JSON dynamically from apps
