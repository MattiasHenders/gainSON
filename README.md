### <a name="description"></a> Description

This repo is an effort for future developers to easily get a database of exercises in JSON format for any kind of development that may need it.

Developing apps is hard enough, you shouldn't waste time creating your own database of workouts. 

#### How the final product should work

### <a name="roadmap"></a> Roadmap

These are the goals we hope to hit mostly in order. Create an issue if you want to add to this.

**Milestones**
 - ~~Create the basic JSON object format~~
 - ~~Create the database with exercises~~
 - ~~Generate a JSON from the SQL database~~
 - Add a solid amount of exercises, most workout apps have around 100 so we hope to exceed that
 - Host the database
 - Create an executable app *.exe* 
 - Host a website for quick downloads of the full and some custom JSONs
 - Create ionic plugins that access the database directly
 - Skip the Java executable and find a good way to access the database in a meaningful way
